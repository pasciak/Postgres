/*

This file shows functions that I think will be important in the implementation of the
modified COPY function

Some of them are shortened by the stuff that I found to be uneccesary at the 
first stage of implementation.


!!!!!!!!
BIG NOTE: My comments start with the 'p@' tag. 

At the end of the copy.c file I do preliminary functionality skeleton, somehow based
on the function I picked for this file in here

!!!!!!!!


/*

p@

This structure keeps all the necessary copystate data, I would not modify it too much.
It is the essential container that is passed between all the functions during the
COPY procedure. It can be also called from within the foreign data wrapper. 

We might want to modify/remove some components that are associated with
file reading into/out of disk, but ONLY WHEN we plan on copying between relations.
In such case the CSV flags, markers, delimiters etc might be unnecessary.


Generally, I am not going to modify this here. Mods I have applied before (in the 
copyrel.c file) were two additional Relation structs for source and target relations
needed for COPY between relations. These mods are not found here

p@

This function is the main execution statement that performs the COPY. It is essential.

The utility.c contains the function call, that is mainly defined by 2 things:

-- CopyStmt node that is defined in parsenodes.h and carries the information that is
send from the stdin user input. 

Note that when I played with copyrel.c I tried to make a skeleton of the relation-relation
COPY statement, and for this purpose I added a new node called CopyRelStmt that 
included the new info, such as input and output relations.

-- QueryString  that carries the query infromation.


NOTE also that nodeFuncs.c keeps the function that is used to driectly read string, scalar etc
fields from the input line. We might want to modify this if we
add new functionality that requires new input parameters/strings. 

 QUESTION: Can the QueryString be NULL when we dont use select statement on the COPY TO 
 statement?

This else ... if ...   distinguishes between teh relation and the querry and makes

We want to  COPY between postgres relation and FDW both ways, that is why we
